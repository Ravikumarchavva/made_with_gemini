## Retro Kitchen to Modern Open-Concept Transformation Plan

**Overall Concept:**

The goal is to create a clean, minimalist aesthetic with a focus on functionality and natural light. This involves removing the dated elements and replacing them with modern, sleek alternatives.

**Detailed Renovation Plan:**

1.  **Cabinets:**

    *   **Action:** Replace the mint green cabinets with handle-less cabinets in white, light gray, or a natural wood finish. Incorporate some open shelving.

2.  **Countertops:**

    *   **Action:** Swap the dark countertops for light-colored quartz or granite.
    *   **Estimated Cost:**
        *   **Quartz:** ₹4,000 - ₹8,000 per square foot
        *   **Granite:** ₹3,000 - ₹7,000 per square foot

3.  **Backsplash:**

    *   **Action:** Remove the tiled backsplash and install a modern backsplash (subway tile, glass tile, or a slab matching the countertops).
    *   **Estimated Cost:**
        *   **Subway Tile:** ₹50 - ₹200 per tile
        *   **Glass Tile:** ₹200 - ₹500 per tile
        *   **Slab Backsplash:** (Same as countertop cost, plus installation)

4.  **Appliances:**

    *   **Action:** Replace the vintage appliances with stainless steel, integrated appliances.
    *   **Estimated Cost:**
        *   **Refrigerator:** ₹25,000 - ₹80,000+
        *   **Stove/Oven:** ₹15,000 - ₹60,000+

5.  **Flooring:**

    *   **Estimated Cost:**
        *   **Tile:** ₹80 - ₹500 per square foot
        *   **Concrete:** ₹200 - ₹600 per square foot (including polishing)

6.  **Lighting:**

    *   **Action:** Update lighting with recessed lights, pendant lights, and under-cabinet lighting.
    *   **Estimated Cost:** ₹10,000 - ₹30,000+ (depending on the number of fixtures and complexity of wiring)

7.  **Dining Area:**

    *   **Action:** Replace the red retro table and chairs with a modern dining set or a kitchen island with seating.
    *   **Estimated Cost:** ₹15,000 - ₹50,000+ (depending on the furniture)

8.  **Walls:**

    *   **Action:** Remove the wallpaper and paint the walls in a light, neutral color.
    *   **Estimated Cost:** ₹5,000 - ₹15,000 (including labor and materials)

**Additional Considerations:**

*   **Labor Costs:**  Factor in labor costs for demolition, installation, plumbing, and electrical work. These can vary widely depending on your location and the complexity of the job.
*   **Open Concept:** If you plan to open up the kitchen to another room, you'll need to factor in the cost of removing walls, rerouting utilities, and structural support. This can significantly increase the overall budget.
*   **Unexpected Costs:**  Always budget for unexpected issues that may arise during the renovation process (e.g., hidden plumbing or electrical problems). A contingency fund of 10-15% of the total budget is recommended.

**Disclaimer:** These are rough estimates. It's essential to get detailed quotes from contractors and suppliers in your area for a more accurate budget.
